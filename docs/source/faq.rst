Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I found a bug. What should I do?
--------------------------------

Report it (Email: lpc at cmu dot edu). If there is a little test case, then I
can promise that I will fix it as soon as possible. Most bugs get fixed the
same day.

This is a really obvious bug. Didn't anyone notice it before?
-------------------------------------------------------------

No.

It probably worked at some point, but with many upgrades and the change from
Numeric to numpy, it became stale.

This is why bug reports are so welcome.

Pymorph is slow. What can I do?
--------------------------------

You can use `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`_ for some of the
operations. They're implemented in C++ and are much faster. However, pymorph is
more complete.
