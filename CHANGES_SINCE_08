===========================
Changes Since Version 0.80
===========================

 + numpy is used (instead of Numeric).

 + Function names no longer start with mm.
    A function name  prefix is matlabish and not pythonic.
 
 + Some function names have changed:
    clohole -> close_holes
    ero -> erode
    cero -> cerode
    dil -> dilate
    cdil -> cdilate
    sedil -> sedilate
    add4dil -> add4dilate
    uint8 -> to_uint8
 
 + Some functions were removed:
    * Registration functions
        mminstall, mmversion, mmregister
    * Functions which are easily replaced with array operations:
        mmcmp, mmis, mmislesseq, mmstats

The pymorph.compat module contains the old names and removed functions. Its use for new code is discouraged
