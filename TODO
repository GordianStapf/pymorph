For 1.0:

- Convert all docstrings to numpy format. Regenerate docs [December 8 2009]

- Remove compat.py [December 8 2009]

- Change colour images to be H x W x 3, instead of 3 x H x W.
    Be consistent with matplotlib.
    [Fixed in overlay() & randomcolor()]

- Have at least one unit test for all functions with more than one
    line of code [December 9 2009]

- Make sure that the following is observed
    * images are called f
    * parameter names are lowercase
    * structuring elements are called B, Bc, Bdil,...
    * counts are called n

For later:

- Implement surf() --- unfortunately, it's not clear what the algorithm should be.
    I am sure that a very simple filter would work, but I am not sure which filter.
    Trial&error should give a decent result, though [December 8 2009]

- Write non-apidoc docs [December 8 2009]

- Build a .deb package [Dec 17 2009]
